# Milestones, Progress, and Effectiveness

Data Science Teams often find it challenging to consistently anticipate how long it will take to complete a problem. This in turn makes it difficult to provide reasonable expectations and timelines to other teams and stakeholders. In order to pacify stakeholders, data science teams must spend valuable time creating reports and status updates.

For most data science tasks, it's not possible to forecast a timeline. It's a rock and a hard place. If you forecast what you think it'll take, then you'll often miss your deadlines and upset everyone. Many teams start this way and after getting burned a few times, they gradually start expanding the timelines to include a buffer.

The problem is that this blows up your project timeline. Work dilates to fill the time we have to do it.

Instead we should be focusing on the following key metrics:

- Iteration speed
- Success rates
- Time spent by work type
