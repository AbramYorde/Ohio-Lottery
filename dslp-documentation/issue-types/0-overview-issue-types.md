# Issue Types

For each of the major worktypes in the life of a data science project, we've created an issue template to help guide you through the process and ensure you capture what you need.

There are issue templates for the following issue types:

- [Issue Types](#issue-types)
  - [Ask](#ask)
  - [Data](#data)
    - [Data Acquistion](#data-acquistion)
    - [Dataset Creation](#dataset-creation)
  - [Explore](#explore)
  - [Experiment](#experiment)
  - [Model](#model)

## Ask

Ask issues are for capturing, scoping, and refining the value-based problems your team is trying to solve. They serve as a live definition of work for your projects and will be the anchor for coordinating the rest of the work you do.

## Data

Data issues are for collaborating on gathering and creating the datasets needed to solve a problem. There are two primary types of data issues: Data Acquistion and Dataset Creation.

[Data Issue docs](./2-data-issues.md)

### Data Acquistion

Data Acquisition issues are for gathering data from existing sources. The end goal is to load the data into your working environment via a data ingestion pipeline.

### Dataset Creation

Dataset Creation issues are for collaborating on creating new datasets that are needed to solve your problem. This can involve combining existing datasets together in new ways or it can be creating data pipelines for ingesting new data from a new source. 

## Explore

Explore issues give us a way to provide quick summaries and TLDRs for the exploratory work we do. The goal of explore issues is to increase our understanding of the data and to share those insights with others.

[Explore Issue docs](./3-explore-issues.md)

## Experiment

Experiment issues are for tracking and collaborating on the various approaches taken to solve a problem and for capturing the results.

[Experiment Issue docs](./4-experiment-issues.md)

## Model

Model issues are for working to productionalize your successful experiments so that you can deploy them. This will often involve writing tests, creating pipelines, parametrizing runs, and adding additional monitoring and logging.
